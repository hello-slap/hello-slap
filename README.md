## Hi there and welcome!

We're so glad welcoming you right here. This profile is meant to get in touch with our with our potential new teammate. We're doing it this way, to get a perfect match for you as well as us.  

We have found that the traditional ways of recruiting, such as multiple interviews and letters of application are difficult to reconcile with the expectations of both parties and in the worst case lead to unnecessary waste of time.  

So now we would like to introduce ourselves to you, let you dive a little bit into our world and learn a little bit more about the things you are passionate about.

## This is us

We are a department within the IT of a large company providing security solutions and services. 
Our task is primarily to provide, operate and further develop the application software used internally for work.

## This is what we're looking for

You would be a perfect fit for us if you are an open-minded, curious, and willingly nerdy person who is interested in computer science, software development, and how application software works.  
Ideally, your interest doesn't end at the office door, but you also invest some of your free time in your own IT projects. Many of us have own server-based applications at home, tinker with their smart home or develop their own small applications. We like it very much to be able to talk shop with you about such non-work related things.
