## Hi there and welcome! 👋

It is our pleasure to welcome you here. This profile is meant to get in touch with our potential new teammate. We're doing it this way, to get a perfect match for you as well as for us.  

We have found that the traditional ways of recruiting, such as multiple interviews, letters of application and pre-selection based on CVs are difficult to reconcile with the expectations of both parties and in the worst case lead to unnecessary waste of time. On top of that, you only get a very superficial impression of what you're stumbling into. We would like to handle that differently. Sure thing - we can't avoid the formalities completely but maybe we can shorten it a bit.  

So now we would like to introduce ourselves to you, let you dive a little bit into our world and learn more about the things you are passionate about.  

## This is us 👩‍💻👨‍💻

We are a department within the IT of a large company that provides security solutions and services. Our task is primarily the provision, operation and further development of the application software used internally for work.  

In addition to system operation, we also develop and maintain our own small applications that are needed by our customers or serve to improve business processes inside or outside of IT. Mostly these are backend applications, automation stuff or frontend customizations for well-known tools. But don't expect to be a cog in the wheel of a classic ISV - our team members mostly remain responsible for their creations themselves.  

What we like most about working together is the friendly, appreciative, respectful and open atmosphere within the team. You can ask anyone anything. There are no stupid questions.  
If you feel like it, we are happy to meet you (online or irl) and have fun together. No matter if it's for leisure activities, going out for dinner, gaming or just the after work drink - there is no fixed agenda for it as long as it brings us joy. Of course, it's also totally okay if you don't want to join.  

With us you will meet some people whose interest does not end at the office door, but who also invest part of their free time in their own small IT projects. We'd love to exchange ideas with you about such non-work related things.

## This is what we're looking for 🐱‍💻🤗

You are a perfect fit for us if you are an open-minded, curious, creative and willingly nerdy person who is interested in computer science, software development or how application software works. If something doesn't work the way it should, it won't leave you alone until you solve the puzzle - no matter if you find the solution by yourself or in collaboration with your teammates.  

For us it is also important to value each other, to be open to diversity and against any kind of discrimination - so we are very happy if you share this attitude.  

To get a rough idea of what you may have in your competency toolbox from a technical perspective, take a closer look at the profile descriptions:

- [System Administrator or DevOps Specialist](./YOU-want2join-as-operator.md)

If you enjoy attending technical conferences, that's a plus, so your new colleagues can take advantage of the opportunity to participate and share together.  

## Where do we go from here? 🐇⁉

Now that we've hopefully given you a good idea of who we are and what we're looking for, we've prepared a few little challenges that are primarily meant to be fun and awaken the puzzle lover in you.  

If you're still with us, you're good to go - **[so follow us down the rabbit hole....](./WE-love-puzzles.md)** ⬅
