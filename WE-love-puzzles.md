# Let's have some fun together! 🥳

## Not exactly the same procedure (as every year) 🔀

In a nutshell, we want you to look at the puzzles we've created for you to find a more or less creative solution and share it with us by sending us a pull request.  

## Rules 📜

Honestly, there aren't really any. Be nice and gentle, don't cheat (in any way), and enjoy.  

Whether you want to go with the one puzzle that interests you the most, or do a few - it doesn't matter. Do it however you want, and just make sure we can identify your contribution so we can match it to your application later.
