# The SLAP-FAQ answers your questions - hopefully!

## How large is the team?

Well - we're about 20 to 30 people. It depends - sometimes we'll have some temporary members.  

## Do I'll have flexible work hours?

On the whole, you can organize your time quite freely. There are a few occasions that require some time management, but not on a regular basis.  

## How flexible will I be exactly?

Let's talk about it in a face-to-face conversation.  

## Do you come into the office every day or can I work from home?

Currently, there is no need to be in the office unless there are scheduled team meetings or special tasks that need to be completed on-site. There is a small chance that company policy will dictate a 50:50 arrangement in the future.  

## Do only men work for you?

Nope. We are happy to be a mixed team.  

## After I started with you people, what is the onboarding like?

It depends a bit wether you are hiring as a developer or an operator. But you'll definitely get a few weeks to get acquainted with everything first. In the daily meetings you will certainly be there from the beginning, so that you can see everyone, get an impression of how we work and ask us questions.  
We will help you with all organizational issues - which will be quite a few - and will try to give you as much input as possible on the topics we want to entrust you with.  

## Is there permanent effort recording?

Nope. Not in general - maybe special project but only very roughly.  

## Will I have time within my work hours to improve my skills?

That's a yes!
